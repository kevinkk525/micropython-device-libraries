# micropython-device-libraries
Just a collection of micropython device libraries

The libraries here are mostly other repositories as submodules, so check these repositories for licenses and documentation.
I use this repository to link all interesting libraries I wish to include in my project [Pysmartnode](https://github.com/kevinkk525/pysmartnode)
